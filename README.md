🔐 Java Cipher Implementations

This repository contains Java implementations of three fundamental encryption algorithms: XOR Cipher, Caesar Cipher, and a Substitution Cipher. These examples are ideal for understanding how classical encryption methods work at a basic level.

📂 Features

1. 🔑 XOR Cipher

A lightweight symmetric encryption method where each character is encrypted using the XOR (exclusive OR) bitwise operation with a key.

    Uses a fixed XOR key (currently 0)

    Same logic is used for both encryption and decryption

    Best for illustrating how reversible logic works

2. 🔐 Caesar Cipher

One of the oldest known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions.

    Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters

    Preserves special characters

    Ignores spaces in encryption

    Includes both encryption and decryption

3. 🔄 Substitution Cipher

A variant of the Caesar Cipher that replaces each letter with another based on a shift value.

    Works similarly to Caesar Cipher

    Skips spaces

    Maintains non-alphabetic characters

    Simple example of monoalphabetic substitution logic
